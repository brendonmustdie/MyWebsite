          <h2 class="head">I Think We Would Kill Vannaver Bush:</h2>
          <h3 class="head">Re: As We May Think - Vannaver Bush</h3>
  
          <p> From the introduction of this paper, and Bush himself, we can already kind of get the sense that this paper is about the beginnings of the internet. Supposedly Bush “urges” scientists to make our knowledge more accessible (a feat that has not quite yet been attained, if you’ve ever tried to access an academic paper behind a paywall, you know what I mean). The concept that the internet extends man’s “powers of his mind” makes this paper seem more and more interesting because, in theory, that’s what the internet is. 
            </p>
          <p>
            Bush has a few concepts in this paper: What do scientist’s do after war? And Accessiblity of knowledge. How will technology extended what they already have? How much does economy affect science? 
          </p>
          <p>
            Bush has this concept that physicists have been “thrown off stride” by making weapons of destruction for war – and of course he’s right. Scientist’s did their part in helping win the war, but what about now? There has to be some kind of post-traumatic-stress from knowing how many deaths you are partially responsible for? Where do you go when the subject you loved made you a "bad guy"? I don’t think I could ever deal with myself if my passion had hurt someone. 
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Bush touches on an interesting concept, the idea of the shear amount of research being done and the conclusions not being shared wide enough, meaning scientists all over the world may be struggling to prove the same conclusions in different places, with no way to share results or ideas. This research becomes increasingly important but if every person has to do all the research themselves, there is no time for improvement. 
          </p>
  
          <p>          Bush’s example is Mendel’s concept of laws and genetics, who’s publication did not reach “the few who were capable of grasping and extending it”. I’d never really thought about that before – the internet has been around as long as I have been and it’s weird to imagine the world without it. </p>
        <p>          Bush’s thoughts on what could be invented in the decades to follow are astounding – because most, if not all, have been invented or are in the works. He takes what he already knows and pushes the boundaries ever-so-slightly. It goes without saying that a fair amount of this paper is daydreaming about what could be in the future. This is how we would kill him. </p>
        <p>All this daydreaming about accessible knowledge – which has become completely possible, and then put behind the money (needed for science, but should it’s reader’s be responsible). And then more daydreaming about technology – that has become real, that we take almost for granted. Today I took a picture of the back of my head, to see if my hair was straightened. (Maybe, if we don’t kill him, he’d kill himself)</p>
      <p>          To quote Bush, “Thus far we seem to be worse off than before…” Oh, Bush. You have no idea. Try telling Bush how much of our technology is used for politics, or money, or worse – spreading false information. </p>
