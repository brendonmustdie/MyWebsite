    <h2>Accessibility tools for developers</h2>
    <h5>Week 6</h5>
    <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are developed in cooperation with individuals and organizations to provide a standard for web content’s accessibility to meet the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments. There are endless and endless suggestions from websites for tools web developers can use to check whether their websites are accessible according to these standards. Here are a handful:</p>
  <p>Evaluera’s A-Tester checks web page designs against Evaluera’s “WCAG 2.0 Level-AA conformance statements for HTML5 foundation markup” and creating a report so that developers can see where their websites lie on an accessibility scale developed by Evaluera. </p>
<p>A11Y’s Color Contrast Accesibility Validator is a free “website compliance tool” used to check accessibility in regards to colour blindness by checking the colour contrast issues per WCAG guidelines. The results display color combinations that fail to meet the requirements, and provide recommendations on how to fix the issue to become compliant. </p> 
<p>Muhannad Abdelrazek’s a11y-checker warns developers of HTML Markup code accessibility issues – in the consol, developers can see a warning. </p>  
<p>Martin Forstner’s A11Y-sitecheker checks a while site against accessibility critaria by using axe-core to check for issues. </p>  
<p>Orange’s A11ygato is a web interface that allows you to monitor the accessibility of your website. The dashboard let’s you execute audits from a URL or script. You can also schedule audits.
