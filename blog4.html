        Re: Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable
        augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information.
      </h3>


          <p class="extra-info">
            I’ll say it, just in case no one else will: this paper is deeply
            inaccesible. Undefined (or badly defined) terms are strung together in
            long sentences that are hard to make sense of. I’m trying my best to
            work through it but holy hell, is it hard to grasp ANY information being
            shared. (Which is ironic, considering it’s about access to information.)
          </p>
    
          <p>
            This paper explores geographic distributions of information -
            participation and representation. It uses existing statistics and
            previously unmapped data to provide a “broad survey of a rang of key
            platforms”. The paper seeks to demonstate that in addition to uneven
            geographical access, there is also uneven participation and
            representation.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Now here’s an interesting concept: the paper poses that Information has
            always been mobile, and it eventually developed the need to become
            immutable (unchanging) and consistent, because power and information
            become connected. This is an incredibly interesting concept - especially
            in thinking about how information (and misinformation) on the internet
            can be changed and spread.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            The concept that physical places are not just physical places, but
            concepts that are layered in reviews, stories, pictures, maps, and
            postcards is also interesting. The paper states that the combination of
            these “layers” of each object influence how it is thought about and
            interacted with, and therefore changes the place itself. Which means
            that geographic representation is important. “Places invisible or
            discounted in representations are equally invisble in practice to many
            people. A restuarant omitted from a map can cease to be a restaurant if
            nobody finds it.”
          </p>
    
          <p>
            The access to information has been drastically more widespread in the
            past decades - as we experience a revolution that makes computers and
            internet more and more accessible. In theory this should break down the
            barriers between people and information but it doesn’t, necessarily.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Even internet cafes cost money, that some people don’t have. Academic
            papers lie behind paywalls that you can’t access unless you’re from an
            institution or willing to pay for it - again, this wouldn’t be such an
            issue if it was just one website. If Academia.edu had every paper on it
            in the world, most people wouldn’t mind paying for a subscription. But
            it doesn’t. So here we are.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            This widespread information does have some positive effects, though.
            Tapscott and Williams (2006) and Shirky (2011) argue that digital
            participation allows civillians to play a bigger role in politics and
            the content that affects their lives.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            There is an echoed sentiment that once the internet is widespread, all
            people in the world will have equal access to information and
            opportunities. In this vein, Wikipedia seeks to ‘contain the sum of all
            human knowledge’; and Google’s “core mission” is to organize
            information, making it accessible and useful. (Google 2015)
          </p>
    
          <p>
            The paper includes a figure using the data of 2011 study by the Wold
            Bank, tracking internet users and connections per country since the 90s
            - it’s calculated using the internet penetraion of each country and is
            displayed in a cartogram in which the size of each country is determined
            by it’s population of internet users (each hexagon presenting a third of
            a million internet users).
          </p>
    
          <p>
            The paper uses this study to draw conclusions about different regions
            but the bottom line comes to: “- most people on our planet remain
            without access.”
          </p>
    
          <p>
            The paper also touches on affordability, the study the quote talks, not
            only about the cost, but also the cost relative to the average income of
            people in that country, which they use to explain the data in the
            previous study. The figure is published by the International
            Telecommunication Union (ITU 2013) in 2013.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            “Without the ability and means to connect, any chance to participate in
            or contribure to representations of their localities is simply
            impossible.”
          </p>
    
          <p>
            This paper adequetly demonstrates that there are uneven geographies of
            access to communication, and uneven geographies of participation (and
            therefore representation) are sometimes being amplified rather than
            alleviated. It’s very well researched, and demonstrates clearly that
            even the spread of the internet has not donw much to alleviate lack of
            access to informaiton in the global South. I really enjoy how this paper
            points out the effects of colonialism - but I do wish it was more
            recent. I’m sure the studies would reveal different (thankfully)
            information now than it did then.
