        Re: Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable
        augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information.
      </h3>

      <p class="extra-info">
        I’ll say it, just in case no one else will: this paper is deeply
        inaccesible. Undefined (or badly defined) terms are strung together in
        long sentences that are hard to make sense of. I’m trying my best to
        work through it but holy hell, is it hard to grasp ANY information being
        shared. (Which is ironic, considering it’s about access to information.)
      </p>

      <p>
        This paper explores geographic distributions of information -
        participation and representation. It uses existing statistics and
        previously unmapped data to provide a “broad survey of a rang of key
        platforms”. The paper seeks to demonstate that in addition to uneven
        geographical access, there is also uneven participation and
        representation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now here’s an interesting concept: the paper poses that Information has
        always been mobile, and it eventually developed the need to become
        immutable (unchanging) and consistent, because power and information
        become connected. This is an incredibly interesting concept - especially
        in thinking about how information (and misinformation) on the internet
        can be changed and spread.
      </p>

      <p>
        The concept that physical places are not just physical places, but
        concepts that are layered in reviews, stories, pictures, maps, and
        postcards is also interesting. The paper states that the combination of
        these “layers” of each object influence how it is thought about and
        interacted with, and therefore changes the place itself. Which means
        that geographic representation is important. “Places invisible or
        discounted in representations are equally invisble in practice to many
        people. A restuarant omitted from a map can cease to be a restaurant if
        nobody finds it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The access to information has been drastically more widespread in the
        past decades - as we experience a revolution that makes computers and
        internet more and more accessible. In theory this should break down the
        barriers between people and information but it doesn’t, necessarily.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even internet cafes cost money, that some people don’t have. Academic
        papers lie behind paywalls that you can’t access unless you’re from an
        institution or willing to pay for it - again, this wouldn’t be such an
        issue if it was just one website. If Academia.edu had every paper on it
        in the world, most people wouldn’t mind paying for a subscription. But
        it doesn’t. So here we are.
      </p>

      <p>
        This widespread information does have some positive effects, though.
        Tapscott and Williams (2006) and Shirky (2011) argue that digital
        participation allows civillians to play a bigger role in politics and
        the content that affects their lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is an echoed sentiment that once the internet is widespread, all
        people in the world will have equal access to information and
        opportunities. In this vein, Wikipedia seeks to ‘contain the sum of all
        human knowledge’; and Google’s “core mission” is to organize
        information, making it accessible and useful. (Google 2015)
      </p>

      <p>
        The paper includes a figure using the data of 2011 study by the Wold
        Bank, tracking internet users and connections per country since the 90s
        - it’s calculated using the internet penetraion of each country and is
        displayed in a cartogram in which the size of each country is determined
        by it’s population of internet users (each hexagon presenting a third of
        a million internet users).
      </p>

      <p>
        The paper uses this study to draw conclusions about different regions
        but the bottom line comes to: “- most people on our planet remain
        without access.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The paper also touches on affordability, the study the quote talks, not
        only about the cost, but also the cost relative to the average income of
        people in that country, which they use to explain the data in the
        previous study. The figure is published by the International
        Telecommunication Union (ITU 2013) in 2013.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Without the ability and means to connect, any chance to participate in
        or contribure to representations of their localities is simply
        impossible.”
      </p>

      <p>These two figures are the backbone of this paper.</p>
