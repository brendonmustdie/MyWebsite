      <h3 class="center-text">Landing Page</h3>
      <p> My landing page is fairly welcoming, and the "back button" is very noticeable - and obvious. There are some issues with it - the page is scrollable but theres no indication of it. In my next iteration I'll include a nav bar on the left hand side, and maybe an animation that allows users to see they can scroll down. Maybe some bouncing arrows.</p>
    <p>I do find it be lacking and boring, maybe in my next iteration I'll include an about me section. </p>
      <h3 class="center-text"> Gallery Section</h3>
    <p> I'm pretty happy with my gallery section, I think the overlays are great and I think they convey what I wanted them too. The section doesn't have a heading though, which makes it hard to know what it is. I also don't think I indicated very well that you could click on it. Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with it.</p>
    <h3 class="center-text"> Blog Section</h3>
    <p>I'm the most happy with this section. The lack of headings means it's not very clear, but I think the icons and the overlay make it easier to know what's going on. I'm pretty chuffed with the colour palette.</p>
