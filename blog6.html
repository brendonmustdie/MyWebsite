            <h3 class="center-text">Re: Travelling while Trans</h3>
          <p>A trans person myself, you can imagine why the first article I picked to read was travelling while trans. I read it a couple times before writing this, because in some ways my thoughts on the paper feel very private. They are, after all, personal to me and my identity. But most thoughts come down to the same thought: One man's freedom is another man's privacy. A free goverment terrorizes privacy? Whatever. </p> 
          <p> The paper is written by a non-binary femme-presenting individual, travelling from a conference. Going through the airport they acknowledge they're shielded from racist or xenophobic concerns at the airport, but there is going to be a scan of their body that will bring up read flags. The author's physical body doesn't fit into the gender binary and they are bound to get flagged, regardless of whether the TSA agent reads them as female or male. Then they are subdued to a pat-down by a TSA agent - between multiple agents of different genders, arguing right in front of them, about which gender is appropriate to do the pat-down. Holy fuck, I am enraged. </p>
          <p> From a technical aspect, it's virtually impossible to make this work. There's no real way to skip this weirdand awkward part if you're using security scanners: asking someone's gender identity to fill in on the system isn't good enough because your gender identity and your genitals are not the same thing. So could they ask you what genitals you have? Firstly, no. That's a violation. And secondly, (from the view of a paranoid American) there's no way to know whether you're telling the truth or lying about what's in your pants.</p>
          <p class="extra-info"> Also, to make it clear, what's in your pants is absolutely nobody's fucking business.</p>
          <p>I'm actually so upset at this paper that I've taken a short break haha.</p>
          <p> Okay. I think the Design Justice Network is amazing - and I'm going to be printing out a copy of their design principles, and throwing them up on my bedroom wall. We live in a world that has constant diversity - in race, gender, sexual orientation, and disability - and it's ridiculous that our AI cannot keep up. Computers don't make mistakes, humans do. </p>
