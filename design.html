      <h2>Landing page</h2>
      <p>
        For the home page, I wanted to go super plain and calm. I was actually
        inspired by another developers webpage,
        <a href="https://www.wenxinwendyju.com/"> Wendy Ju's page. </a>
        I thought the plain, cool colour would convey a sense of
        professionalism. The large text, to the left of the screen is meant to
        let viewers know they should read that first, before looking at the nav
        bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nav bar being on the right hand side was another inspiration from
        Wendy Ju, I wanted my landing page to be scrollable and I thought Ju's
        page made it clear that you should scroll. I included arrows in my
        design, in case users weren't completely aware of the scroll.
      </p>

      <p>
        There weren't many changes from my original design to the one I ended up
        with, but something that did change is the nav bar. I had a lot of
        technical issues and when I started running out of time, I just got rid
        of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another thing that changes is the back button - in creating my wireframe
        I didn't think about needing javescript and last minute I had to throw a
        back button on there, which is not a good time. But, again, I was
        running out of time and I needed to prioritize.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for this assignment, in relation to the last one: I have nothing of
        the previous website. I started over completely.
      </p>

        src="Images/Wireframe_5.png"
        alt="A Wireframe of the gallery section's original Design"
      />

      <h2>
        Gallery
        <section></section>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I wanted my gallery page to contain a couple screenshots of each game I
        was presenting. I subscribe to a game developers podcast that recommends
        having three games on your portfolio website, and I've only got two that
        I feel like showing off.
      </p>

      <p>
        In comparison to the final, the main reason I didn't alternate the sides
        comes down to technical difficulty. I really struggle with switching
        between C# and html, I don't know why. I spent most of the development
        time working on my game - not because of priorities, but because I
        couldn't sleep without finishing my game - which made it really
        difficult for me to work on the technical parts of this website.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm pretty happy with the gallery section, because I really struggled to
        get those overlays working and I'm quite proud of how they look and
        work. I do think that I should have made it more clear that you could
        click on them to get to their pages.
      </p>

      <img
        class="pic4"
        src="Images/Wireframe_4.png"
        alt="A Wireframe of the blog section's original Design"
      />

      <h2>Blog section</h2>

      <p>
        The blog section stayed about the same, except the resolution of the
        images. I also ended up lining up three in aline, because I thought that
        looked better with the new height and width. I also swapped out from
        images to icons, because I was a bit worried about unity in my webpage.
        I originally had photographs as the covers, but it really messed with
        the colour scheme of the website.
      </p>

      <p>
        In terms of the blog section: I do like the one I ended up with, it was
        fun to include a wider range of pallettes even if it was hard to find
        the right colours. Again, happy with the overlay, and maybe think I
        should have indicated a bit more clearly that they can be clicked on. It
        also made me think that I should maybe add a blue tint to my game images
        but I wasn't quite ready for that.
      </p>

        class="pic4"
        src="Images/Wireframe_3.png"
        alt="A Wireframe of the blog page's original Design"
      />

      <h2>Blog pages</h2>

      <p>
        This design of the blog page was inspired by a bunch of recipe blogs
        that I visited -none interesting enough to really mention. The original
        idea featured as photograph in the beginning of the blog post but as I
        went through the blogs that I wrote, none of them really had relevant
        photographs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another reason this changed is the change in the home page - I replaced
        those photos with icons and I thought it would really disrupt the
        website's unity if I had irrelevant photographs on each of my blog pages
      </p>

      <img
        class="pic4"
        src="Images/Wireframe_2.png"
        alt="The colour palette for this website"
      />

      <h2>Colour Palette</h2>

      <p>
        The colour palette for this website was inspired by the previous website
        - I picked blue because it conveys intelligence and professionalism. And
        I went for the shade of blue I did because it seemed calming and
        knowing. Blue is also my favourite colour. The other colours - more
        green than blue - were created using adobe. I needed to find colours for
        my blog icons and I needed them to feel like they fit both the darker
        shade and the lighter, background shade. Overall, I like them, but I
        might consider going more purple for my next iteration of the website. I
        thought the purple would be too feminine (as a genderqueer person,
        femininity is my biggest fear) and I thought green would come off more
        professional (is there a connextion between masculinity and
        professionalism? Probably.)
