    <h1 class="head">The One Ring:</h1>
    <h2 class="head">The Design Process:</h2>
    <h3 class="head">Conceptualize 001:</h3>
    <p>
      I want to make a 3D ring, based on the Lord of the Rings ring, and I want
      the player to be able to move it and play as the ring.
    </p>
    <p class="extra-info">
      For a marker, not well accquinted with the ring: It makes the wearer
      invisible to all beings, other than one other species - Ringwraiths. It
      also has some emotional influence over it’s wearer, causing a strong
      attachment to it. It’s got more too it - I’ll bring them up as they become
      relevant.
    </p>
    <p class="mini-heading head">Research:</p>
    <p>
      I have a ring, so I played around with what it would be like to move as
      the ring and also had a look online for what kind of ring movements would
      be interesting and cool to play with. I also looked at coincs, and tried
      rooling around a R5 coin to get an idea for what I wanted. I settled on
      the two following kinds of movement: flipping, and rolling. <br />
      I also played "I am Bread" with an xbox controller. To get the idea of
      what it’s like moving a sentient object - without arms or legs. I thought
      it did an excellent job and definitely caused chaos by requiring players
      to sync their controller movements to each corner of the slice of bread.
    </p>
    <h3 class="head">Rapid Prototype:</h3>
    <p>
      The only real way to get this movement realistic and satisfying is to make
      it a physics object. Earlier this year I wrestled with 3D animation for a
      microbuild and let’s just say it’s easier using physics. I used a 3D
      cylinder, that I made short, like a coin, and turned on it’s side and used
      unity’s Constant Force component to get a feel for what I needed to add.
    </p>

    <p class="mini-heading head">Playtest and Iterate:</p>
    <p>
      Prototype 1.1: I spent a lot of time playtesting this, and settled on the
      idea that until I could control it myself, I wouldn’t get a real feel for
      what force I actually needed. At this point I’m worried the ring will be
      too difficult to control. So I add a character controller, and get
      rolling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prototype 1.2: The ring is a bit hard to turn, and I really want the
      movement to feel dynamic and easy. The ring frequently falls over, and
      it’s flipping movement is much slower, less smooth, and harder to
      navigate. I need a way for the player to be able to spin the ring on it’s
      edge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prototype 1.3: I tweaked the movement slightly, so now players can use the
      triggers to turn the ring on it’s y axis. The sticks on a controller move
      it’s x and z, respectively. I also find that I’m unsure of how to
      implement this on mouse and keyboard but I’ll cross that bridge when I get
      there - right now I’m having too much fun to think.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prototype 1.4:I’m still worried the movement is a little shaky but it’s
      the shaky and unbalanced-ness that makes it fun to play around with. But
      at this point I’m worried the cylinder has too many edges and that’s
      messing with the smoothness of rolling. So I get a torus from blender,
      make it gold for special effects, and use that as my ring.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prototype 1.5: This is amazing. The edges of the torus are almost
      completely smooth, or at least smoother than the cylinder. It also seems
      like the edge isn’t completely flat, making it virtually impossible to
      stay upright - this adds an unexpected dynamic to the movement. Spinning
      is a lot more fun and the struggle to stay upright makes it way more fun
      to try and get upright at all. Having a lot of fun. But I do have an issue
      here: There’s nothing to play with.
    </p>
    <p class="extra-info">
      For a marker, not well accquinted with the ring: Gandalf thinks the ring’s
      aim is to get back to it’s evil creator, and what the ring influences
      people to do is determined by whether or not that will get it closer to
      his creator. (I don’t think this is the case, but that would theoretically
      be the ring’s objective in the game)
    </p>
    <p>
      The ring’s movement is perfect to fit this concept, because the slow,
      difficult, clumsy movement, might compel players to “get found” and “worn”
      as the ring, which could be a fun idea to play with.
    </p>
    <p>
      I completely forgot this but at some point I attached a camera and gave
      players complete control over it. Oops.
    </p>
    <h3 class="head">Prototype 002:</h3>
    <p>
      Now that player’s can move, I can approach what actually draws me to The
      One Ring. I’ve started reading the Lord of the Rings trilogy and something
      that really gets me about the ring is that it’s mischevious and sentient.
      The real back bone of this game would be all the mischief the player could
      accomplish - and should accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found some free to use 3D models of chess pieces and added rigidbodies
      to them. I liked this concept because it showed the scale of the ring and
      also gave playtesters something to push over and play around with.
    </p>

    <p class="mini-heading head">Playtest and Iterate:</p>
    <p>
      Prototype 2.1: I spent lots and lots of time trying to push chess pieces
      over, but as a ring half the size and weight of the chess pieces I didn’t
      really have many choices. The actual moment I decided to make a game based
      on the ring was the one I read a paragraph describing when the ring
      resized itself*, slipped off a man’s finger, and caused his death. So I
      added a button so that players could scale-up and scale-down the ring -
      and set max and min sizes.
    </p>
    <p class="extra-info">*The ring can resize itself</p>

    <p>
      Prototype 2.2: I am having the most fun making this game than I’ve ever
      had making a game. There is a small technical error which is that if you
      size up and down rapidly enough, sometimes players can glitch through the
      floor. I’ve tried changing the rate at which it grows. But any faster or
      any slower and the glitching happens even faster. Another technical issue
      that I’m having is that the ring has a hole in it, and the mesh doesn’t
      allow me to put a chess piece through that hole - which is what most
      people would probably try. I’m going to talk to my lecturer, Tim, about
      this in a consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other than that, the chess pieces make for a wonderful addition - I can’t
      wait to have more objects to play around with. I do struggle slightly to
      tip them over, so I’m going to play around with the mass of the ring while
      I wait for my consulation with Tim.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prototype 2.3: I tried just pushing the mass up all the way, but that does
      make it much harder to move and while I cited that as a good thing
      earlier, the ring is way too heavy to even think about mischief and how it
      wobbles. Instead, now, the mass of the ring goes up while the size of it
      does, which makes it much more noticeable that the ring has grown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another concept that’s really interesting to me about the growth - playing
      into wanting to be picked up - is that player’s can choose to avoid
      detection if they remain small enough that NPCs cannot see them. Which
      kind of makes me want to make the ring invisible, so I can’t stop working
      quite yet.
    </p>

    <h3 class="head">Prototype 003:</h3>
    <p>
      The ring makes it’s wearer invisible, so it’s stands to reason that it
      should be able to make itself invisible too, right? At this point, I’ve
      only spent like 3 hours on this microbuild and I don’t know what to do
      with myself so I’m going to keep going. Invisibility should take a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote a script that faded in and out, between the two materials: gold
      and transparent, and because of their different rendering modes, this (in
      short) fucked everything. The ring was fine until you switched to
      transparent and back - half the ring switched back to gold, and the other
      half got stuck halfway. At some point, in attempting to switch back and
      forth, I broke it so hard that the ring wasn’t gold OR transparent - it
      simply had the grey-and-white check pattern of “just pretend I’m
      transparent”.
    </p>
    <p class="mini-heading head">Playtest and Iterate:</p>
    <p>
      Prototype 3.1: I realized the issue was probably the different rendering
      modes of the two materials, but there was no way for me to change the
      rendering mode on the transparent material. So I changed it on the gold
      material. Mistake. For some reason even when the ring was gold it was
      trying to be transparent, so you could see the inside of the ring from the
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prototype 3.2: I realized the actual problem was that I was trying to
      *fade between materials,* and I decided to give up on that dream. Instead
      I wrote some code that moved directly between the materials, without a
      fade. And that worked! Hurray!
    </p>

    <h3 class="head">Prototype 004:</h3>
    <p>
      I should go to bed, I should. It’s just that I’m having so much fun. The
      ring makes itself invisible but because it also makes it’s wearer
      invisible, I should write code for that too, while I’m here…
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote some code that would find objects the ring is touching when it
      turns invisible, and add them to a dictionary. The array then gets run
      through a function that turns that object invisible as well.
    </p>
    <p class="mini-heading head">Playtest and Iterate:</p>
    <p>
      Prototype 4.1: So this dictionary doesn’t account for items it’s already
      touching when it turns invisible so I added that as well. Also, another
      tech issue I’m having is that this doesn’t work on the white chess pieces
      - it turns the “green felt” under them transparent so I might have to just
      rework them in blender to change it, because it seem the green felt is
      their parent object. So I just wrote a bool into the array to check
      whether it already is in the array, and if it isn’t, to add it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prototype 4.2: Perfect. This turns other objects invisible, in case I
      wasn’t having fun before - I’m having a lot of fun now. Tomorrow I have a
      consultation with Tim and I’ll bring up my tech issues with him. For now,
      I’m going to sleep.
