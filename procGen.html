        <p>
          For an assignment I created a “procedural generation algorithim” which
          used prefabs in unity to spawn rooms where I wanted them. I add
          empties in my prefabs, and in code set which opening they were in, and
          which rooms could therefore instantiate. I then wrote a function to
          randomly instantiate rooms from arrays. At the time, I was pretty
          happy with this idea, however I encountered some technical problems:
        </p>
        <p>
          - Sometimes the rooms spawnned at different heights, and were tilted
          at strange angles.
        </p>
        <p>- It wouldn’t open in a build.</p>
        <p>
          Procedural generation interests me and I’m spending more time figuring
          out ways to do it.

        <p>
          I researched Depth First Search, on the instruction of a lecturer, and
          I’m excited about what it could mean. If I could build a grid, and use
          a system like DFS, I could randomly generate a maze! And slightly
          altering that could make a dungeon!
