    <p>
      For an assignment I created a “procedural generation algorithim” which
      used prefabs in unity to spawn rooms where I wanted them. I add
      empties in my prefabs, and in code set which opening they were in, and
      which rooms could therefore instantiate. I then wrote a function to
      randomly instantiate rooms from arrays. At the time, I was pretty
      happy with this idea, however I encountered some technical problems:
    </p>
    <p>
      - Sometimes the rooms spawnned at different heights, and were tilted
      at strange angles.
    </p>
    <p>- It wouldn’t open in a build.</p>
    <p>
      Procedural generation interests me and I’m spending more time figuring
      out ways to do it.

    <p>
      I researched Depth First Search, on the instruction of a lecturer, and
      I’m excited about what it could mean. If I could build a grid, and use
      a system like DFS, I could randomly generate a maze! And slightly
      altering that could make a dungeon!
